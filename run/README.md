# run

This directory contains a Docker image capable of running a Vulkan program with GLFW3, and
presenting a VNC server to a Desktop capable of showing the Vulkan program. The sample program is
expected to have already been compiled before running this image. Once the sample program has been
compiled, run `run.bash` to build and launch the container.
